**Instructions for use**

In the terminal run: alias ba="java -cp target/classes edu.grinnell.csc207.main.BrailleASCII"

Then, you can use three different modes:

1. braille. Convert ASCII text to braille bit strings. Example "ba braille hello"
2. ascii. Convert braille bit strings to ASCII text. Example "ba ascii 110010100010111000111000101010"
3. unicode. Convert ASCII text to Unicode braille characters. "ba unicode hello"
